# HerKoole

## Introduction

I want to learn about evolutionary algorithms, so I have created this repository to implement some of its algorithms here.
I am reading the **Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms** book from Springer.
Repository name comes from [Disney's Hercules](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney's_Hercules_(video_game)>) Video Game.

## Structure

I am trying to create a generic structure for evolutionary algorithms, but I am not sure this structure is good or useful.

## Up and Running

```bash
python3 herkoole/main.py -v --info tsp_example.txt -t 3000 -p tsp
```

```bash
python3 herkoole/main.py -v --info knapsack_example.txt -t 3000 -p knapsack
```
